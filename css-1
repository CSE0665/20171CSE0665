Highlights


* States spent around Rs 2 lakh crore over the last five years for policing but still has a shortage of 0.5 million policemen

* <intro>Around 47,000 police personnel deployed to protect 14,842 special persons</intro>

* <span class="b"> UP, Maharashtra and Gujarat have the highest difference between sanctioned policemen and actual policemen on duty</span>


 

<span class="c">It’s a large country and thus must have lots of important people. But 14,842 VIPs might be a surprise, or maybe not.  Considering that 47,000 policemen are deployed only to keep these VIPs safe and happy when there are 500,000 policemen short might seem a little stretched.</span>
